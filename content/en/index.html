        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          I design both small and large web applications with 20 years of experience. In recent years, the largest systems I have designed are in the magnitude of tens of person-years and operate globally in dozens of languages. I help your team find the best technical solutions that enable building functionality and increase efficiency.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
          When coding, I primarily use functional languages, such as Scala. Higher-level programming languages enable writing programs quickly and error-free. In software projects, most of the time is spent on coding, which is why I continuously maintain extensive expertise in various programming languages.
        </p>
        <h2>DevOps</h2>
        <p>
          Software deployment often involves too many outages and failures. I can develop DevOps processes and improve them or help implement new tools. I personally prefer using Ansible, which significantly improves process quality and human productivity. Infrastructure can be transformed into code and accelerate requirement lead times.
        </p>
        <h2>Rescue Operations</h2>
        <p>
          I have often joined software projects when problems have already become significant. Complex situations may require major changes in addition to technical insights. For example, optimizing one organization's critical function from 20 minutes to two seconds required not only architecture and code changes but also a paradigm shift.
